## 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Behar

I'm completing my **B.Sc. in Data Science & Engineering** at the **Technion**.  
My passion for data started long before my degree- when I realized how limited old football stats like *shots on target* were, and how advanced metrics like *expected goals (xG)* can truly change how we evaluate performance. 

Since then, I’ve been fascinated by how **data transforms decision-making**, whether in sports, finance, or public policy.
